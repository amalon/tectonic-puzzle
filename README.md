Tectonic Plates Puzzle for 3D Printing
======================================

This project is to create a 20cm diameter 3D printable magnetic globe puzzle of
the Earth's tectonic plates and internal structure. This is a little smaller
than a 10-pin bowling ball, and consists of the following parts:

 - 2 labelled yellow inner core hemispheres, attached together magnetically.

 - 4 labelled orange outer core quadrants.

   - No magnetic attachment (the outer core is liquid after all).
 - 8 unique labelled red mantle segments, attached together magnetically.

   - Each is additionally uniquely labelled, to aid quick assembly:
     - The first letter is "N" for Northern hemisphere or "S" for Southern
       hemisphere.
     - The second letter is "E" for Eastern hemisphere or "W" for Western
       hemisphere.
     - The second letter may be repeated for far east or far west segments, i.e.
       the night-time hemisphere at noon GMT.
   - Each has 3 magnet slots to attach to 3 other mantle segments.
   - Each has magnet slots to attach the 28 tectonic plate pieces to.
   - The outside shape corresponds to the approximate shape of the Moho
     discontinuity, the boundary between the mantle and the crust, vertically
     exaggerated 5x.
 - 28 colourful tectonic plate pieces, magnetically attached to the mantle
   segments, on a single 256mm build plate.
   - 20 main plate groups. Micro-plates that are too small for magnets are
     physically connected to neighbouring plates, but separated by a trench to
     mantle depth.

     filament changes during printing.

   - A fixed depth of mantle is embedded in each piece to allow space for
     magnets and to physically connect grouped microplates.
   - Each is shaped corresponding to the topology of the land and ocean floor,
     and the depth of the Moho discontinuity, to fit against the mantle
     segments.
     - Lines of latitude and longitude at 10 degree intervals in the ocean are
       raised to sea level, allowing both the topology of the sea floor and the
       depth of the ocean to be seen.
     - Topology is vertically exaggerated 5x to make it more visible.
     - High frequency surface topology (e.g. mountains) in the 5400x2700 DEM are
       exaggerated a further 2x relative to a 1/7.5 scaled down 720x360 DEM.
       This exaggerates fine features without scaling up the larger features or
       plate depths.

The tectonic plate pieces are multi-coloured on all sides. The colours have been
limited to 4 (as supported by the BambuLab AMS lite) with the following colours
being prioritised:
 - Blue represents the sea floor. This is important to distinguish land and sea,
   and allow recognition of familiar landmasses & oceans.
 - Green represents land (including Ice & Sand, such as Antarctica). This is the
   recognisable colour associated with land, and makes the whole thing
   pleasantly colourful.
 - Dark grey represents crust, allowing the relative crust depth to be visible
   on the sides of the plates. Though not heavily used, its an important aspect
   of the model to represent the thickness of the crust, and representing crust
   with green to allow for other colours wouldn't look right.
 - Red represents mantle. Each plate must embed a fixed depth of mantle to
   increase its thickness (especially thin oceanic crust).

The data and geometry nodes exist in the blend file to generate colouring for
sand and ice, however these haven't been used due to the priorities described
above.

The mantle and core segments limit multi-colour to the first few layers for
text labels. The colours are chosen to approximate relative heat, however they
make no attempt to precisely match any colour temperatures of inner parts of
the earth:
 - The mantle is red with white text, matching the underside of the tectonic
   plate pieces.
 - The outer core is orange with black text.
 - The inner core is yellow with black text.

Note that due to a few small parts and the use of strong magnets, this model is
not suitable for young children.

this repository and various downloaded resources by Blender geometry nodes.
Please refer to the [Development Guide](docs/development.md) for details.


Donate
======

This model was designed to teach my home educated kids about plate tectonics in
a fun and engaging way, however it took a significant amount of time and effort
to create. I've intentionally made it free of charge, but if you are pleased
with the result, please consider supporting me by donating with
