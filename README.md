Tectonic Plates Puzzle for 3D Printing
======================================

This project aims to create a 20cm diameter 3D printable magnetic globe puzzle
of the Earth's tectonic plates and internal structure. This is a little smaller
than a 10-pin bowling ball, and consists of the following parts:

 - 2 labelled yellow inner core hemispheres, attached together magnetically.
 - 4 labelled orange outer core quadrants.
   - No magnetic attachment (the outer core is liquid after all).
 - 8 unique labelled red mantle segments, attached together magnetically.
   - Each is additionally uniquely labelled, to aid quick assembly:
     - The first letter is "N" for Northern hemisphere or "S" for Southern
       hemisphere.
     - The second letter is "E" for Eastern hemisphere or "W" for Western
       hemisphere.
     - The second letter may be repeated for far east or far west segments, i.e.
       the night-time hemisphere at noon GMT.
   - Each has 3 magnet slots to attach to 3 other mantle segments.
   - Each has magnet slots to attach the 28 tectonic plate pieces to.
   - The outside shape corresponds to the approximate shape of the Moho
     discontinuity, the boundary between the mantle and the crust, vertically
     exaggerated 5x.
 - 28 colourful tectonic plate pieces, magnetically attached to the mantle
   segments, on a single 256mm build plate.
   - A fixed depth of mantle is embedded in each piece to allow space for
     magnets and to physically connect grouped microplates.
   - Each is shaped corresponding to the topology of the land and ocean floor,
     and the depth of the Moho discontinuity, to fit against the mantle
     segments.
     - Lines of latitude and longitude at 10 degree intervals in the ocean are
       raised to sea level, allowing both the topology of the sea floor and the
       depth of the ocean to be seen.
     - Topology is vertically exaggerated 5x to make it more visible.
     - High frequency surface topology (e.g. mountains) in the 5400x2700 DEM are
       exaggerated a further 2x relative to a 1/7.5 scaled down 720x360 DEM.
       This exaggerates fine features without scaling up the larger features or
       plate depths.
   - 20 main plate groups. Micro-plates that are too small for magnets are
     physically connected to neighbouring plates, but separated by a trench to
     mantle depth.
   - 6 major plate groups are split in halves long-ways to reduce wastage due to
     filament changes during printing.
   - The Pacific plate is split into thirds.

The tectonic plate pieces are multi-coloured on all sides. The colours have been
limited to 4 (as supported by the BambuLab AMS lite) with the following colours
being prioritised:
 - Blue represents the sea floor. This is important to distinguish land and sea,
   and allow recognition of familiar landmasses & oceans.
 - Green represents land (including Ice & Sand, such as Antarctica). This is the
   recognisable colour associated with land, and makes the whole thing
   pleasantly colourful.
 - Dark grey represents crust, allowing the relative crust depth to be visible
   on the sides of the plates. Though not heavily used, its an important aspect
   of the model to represent the thickness of the crust, and representing crust
   with green to allow for other colours wouldn't look right.
 - Red represents mantle. Each plate must embed a fixed depth of mantle to
   increase its thickness (especially thin oceanic crust).

The data and geometry nodes exist in the blend file to generate colouring for
sand and ice, however these haven't been used due to the priorities described
above.

The mantle and core segments limit multi-colour to the first few layers for
text labels. The colours are chosen to approximate relative heat, however they
make no attempt to precisely match any colour temperatures of inner parts of
the earth:
 - The mantle is red with white text, matching the underside of the tectonic
   plate pieces.
 - The outer core is orange with black text.
 - The inner core is yellow with black text.

3mf File Details
================

Note: please download the final 3mf with high resolution models from a release
rather than using the files straight from the repository, unless you're an
advanced user wanting to make modifications.

The parts are laid out ready for 3D printing in a 3mf file, which is stored in
this repository in the `3mf/` directory, along with very low resolution
placeholder meshes. This can be zipped up into `tectonic-puzzle.3mf` using this
command:
```bash
$ make tectonic-puzzle.3mf
```

Updates can be written back into the `3mf/` directory (also stripping the
absolute paths from source meshes to allow easy reloading) using this command:
```bash
$ make 3mf
```


Build plates
------------

The inner core halves on build plate 1 are identical to one another, and only
use multiple materials for the text labels against the base plate. Variable
layer heights are used to reduce the stepping/contouring effect at the top of
the hemispheres.

The outer core quadrants on build plate 2 are identical to one another, and
only use multiple materials for the text labels against the base plate.
Supports are used for the inner core cutouts. Variable layer heights are used
to reduce the stepping/contouring effect at the top of the quadrants.

The mantle segments on build plates 3 and 4 are unique, and only use multiple
materials for the text labels against the base plate. Supports are used for the
outer core cutouts, but not the magnet slots against the base plate. The
segments on each plate are grouped together in assemblies to allow for variable
layer heights to be used to reduce the stepping/contouring effect at the top of
the segments.

The tectonic plate pieces on build plate 5 are carefully and compactly arranged
on a single build plate to minimise filament wastage while printing upright for
maximum quality on the large faces (avoiding stepping). Supports are used for
the overhanging magnet slots and to print unsliced minor plates on. Some of the
brims, supports, and purge tower edges may overlap slightly which should be
harmless, but it should be carefully checked in case your supports are
generated differently. These have been partly mitigated by grouping some of the
plates together in assemblies to encourage the slicer to generate supports more
sensibly.


Generating High Resolution Models from Source
=============================================

Note: please download the final 3mf with high resolution models from a release
rather than following these instructions, unless you're an advanced user
wanting to make modifications.

You will also need a lot of RAM, blender will easily consume close to 32GB to
generate the high resolution tectonic place meshes, so you'll ideally want at
least 32GB or RAM, preferably 64GB or plenty of swap space, and will probably
want to ensure as many programs as possible are closed.

Run Blender from a terminal, so as to see progress of the export script, since
Blender will become unresponsive while recalculating modifiers.


Generating Core Segments
------------------------

- Open `tectonic-puzzle.blend` in Blender.
- Go to the "Scripting" workspace.
- Enable in the view layer, and make visible, the following collections in the
  "Core" collection:
  - "Base"
  - "Mantle Segments"
  - "Core Segments"
  - "Inner Core Segments"
- If generating placeholder meshes for `3mf/`, set `placeholder = True` in the
  script.
- Otherwise, select "Mantle" in the "Base" collection, and tick the object's
  custom property "detailed" (in the 3D viewport sidebar, or the properties
  panel). Expect Blender to become unresponsive while it recalculates the
  modifiers.
- Select all objects in the "Mantle Segments", "Core Segments", and "Inner Core
  Segments" collections.
- Run the export script. Observe progress in the terminal. The following `.obj`
  files will be created, along with corresponding `.mtl` files:
  - `core_inner.obj`
  - `core_outer.obj`
  - `mantle1.obj` .. `mantle8.obj`
- Undo setting the "Mantle" object's "detailed" custom property to true, or
  untick it again.


Generating Tectonic Plate Pieces
--------------------------------

- Open `tectonic-puzzle.blend` in Blender.
- Go to the "Scripting" workspace.
- Enable in the view layer, and make visible, the following collections in the
  "Tectonic Plates" collection:
  - "Modifier Templates"
  - "Plates for Slicing"
  - "Plate Slices"
  - "Unsliced Plates"
- Select all objects in the "Plate Slices" and "Unsliced Plates" collections.
- If generating placeholder meshes for `3mf/`, set `placeholder = True` in the
  script.
- Run the export script. Expect Blender to become unresponsive for while it
  repeatedly recalculates modifiers for each plate. Observe progress in the
  terminal. `plate_*.obj` files will be created, along with corresponding
  `plate_*.mtl` files.


Importing the OBJ files into Orca Slicer
----------------------------------------

- Build the `tectonic-puzzle.3mf` file with small placeholder meshes using `make`:
```shell
$ make tectonic-puzzle.3mf
```
- Open `tectonic-puzzle.3mf` in Orca Slicer.
- Right click a build plate in the objects hierarchy.
- Select "Reload all". For each mesh object you will be asked to configure the
  mapping between colours and materials.
  - For every file, first use the quick set "Reset" and then "Color match".
  - `core_inner.obj`: set 1 to yellow, 2 to black.
  - `core_outer.obj`: set 1 to orange, 2 to black.
  - `mantle*.obj` (x8): set 1 to red, 2 to white.
  - `plate_*.obj` (x28): hopefully the "Color match" will select the correct
    colours, some combination of blue, green, red and dark grey.
- Some plate pieces may have the wrong colour back. To fix this:
  - Select all plate pieces.
  - Right-click the plates and set filament for the selected items to red.
- The mantle segments have magnet slots against the build plate, which do not
  need support. To fix this:
  - Select each mantle piece in turn.
  - Click the support painting tool.
  - Switch the paint tool to fill.
  - Right click in each of the segment's magnet holes against the base plate to
    disable supports. There are 3 downward facing faces where supports need
    disabling.
  - Exit the support painting tool.


Blender File Details
====================

The parts are generated procedurally from image textures and tectonic plate
boundaries / shapes by Blender geometry nodes and modifiers. As such the main
Blender file, `tectonics-puzzle.blend` is relatively small compared to the
final high resolution meshes.


Model Configuration
-------------------

The "Configuration" collection contains a "Model Configuration" object, with
the following custom properties which control the generation of the models.

Each property has a description which can be seen by hovering the mouse over
it.

Changing these values may cause Blender to become unresponsive while modifiers
are recalculated, so you may want to disable all but a minimum of collections
in the view layer before making changes.


Collections
-----------

- "Configuration": Contains empty objects used purely for holding custom
  properties which various modifiers, geometry nodes, and properties are driven
  by.
- "Plate Boundaries": Contains objects relating to plate boundaries, which are
  made solid and cut out of the tectonic plate pieces to allow tolerance
  between plates and to cut trenches to show when microplates have been grouped
  into adjacent plates.
  - "Plate Boundaries Straight": Contains the raw plate boundaries.
    - "Minor Boundaries": Contains minor boundaries between plates which have
      been grouped together into single puzzle pieces.
    - "Major Boundaries": Contains major boundaries between tectonic plate
      pieces.
  - "Plate Boundaries Joined": Procedurally joins the above collections into
    single objects (one for minor, one for major plate boundaries).
  - "Plate Boundaries Joined & Modified": Procedurally extrudes and bevels the
    joined plate boundaries, and textures them, ready for boolean operations to
    cut out of the tectonic plate pieces.
- "Magnet Positions": Contains linked magnet slot meshes between the crust and
  mantle, contained within empties for easy orientation, and transformed
  according to the model configuration. Each magnet contains a custom property
  used to offset the magnet to align it to the crust-mantle boundary.
  - "Removed": Old magnets, now unused.
  - "Templates": Original magnet slot meshes, oriented to north, which others
    are linked from, allowing easy editing.
- "Negatives": Various collections of linked objects used by boolean modifiers.
  - "Negative Plate Boundaries": Contains linked plate boundary meshes from the
    "Plate Boundaries" collection.
  - "Negative Mantle Meshes": Contains linked magnet slot meshes between mantle
    segments.
  - "Negative Inner Core Meshes": Contains linked magnet slot meshes between
    the inner core hemispheres.
  - "Empty Temp": Empty collection, used as a temporary plate to put meshes
    when editing them.
  - "Negative Crust Magnets": Contains linked magnet slot meshes between the
    crust and mantle.
- "Core"
  - "Base": Contains global mantle, core, and inner core meshes, including
    slightly larger tolerant meshes used for boolean modifiers to allow for
    tolerance. The subdivision of these meshes depends on the "Mantle" object's
    "detailed" custom property.
  - "Labels": Contains label text objects and associated curves for the mantle,
    outer core, and inner core objects.
  - "Mantle Segments": Contains 8 segments of mantle, sliced from the meshes in
    the "Base" collection, with magnet slots cut out and with labels applied.
    These are exported as `mantle1.obj`..`mantle8.obj`.
  - "Core Segments": Contains a quadrant of outer core, sliced from the meshes
    in the "Base" collection and with labels applied. This is exported as
    `outer_core.obj`.
  - "Inner Core Segments": Contains a quadrant of outer core, sliced from the meshes
    in the "Base" collection, with a magnet slot cut out and with labels
    applied. This is exported as `inner_core.obj`.
- "Tectonic Plates": Contains tectonic plate shapes in longitude/latitude
  space, which are procedurally modified to construct the spherical, 3D,
  topographic plate pieces.
  - "Modifier Templates": Contains empty plates with modifiers which can be
    copied to other plates for different situations, for example by the export
    script.
  - "Unused Plates": Contains plates that are unused, e.g. microplates joined
    with other plates.
  - "Plates for Slicing": Contains major plates, which need slicing in half or
    thirds to minimise filament wastage.
  - "Plate Slices": Contains slice geometry used for slicing the above plates.
    The modifiers must be enabled for the slice to be calculated (which is
    taken care of by the export script). These are exported as
    `plate_$name$slice.obj`.
  - "Unsliced Plates": Contains minor plates which do not need slicing. These
    are exported as `plate_$name.obj`.
  - "Plates by mantle segment": Contains linked plates grouped by mantle
    segment (possibly out of date).
