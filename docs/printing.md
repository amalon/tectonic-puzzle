Print Guide
===========

3D printing of this model by others for fun or profit is encouraged. Pease
download the 3MF file from the latest release on Github rather than the source
files in this repository, as the high resolution models are largely generated
procedurally from this repository and various downloaded resources by Blender
geometry nodes (see the [Development Guide](development.md)).

The 3mf files are exported from Orca Slicer. I have not tested them in any
other slicer.


Build Plates
------------

The inner core halves on build plate 1 are identical to one another, and only
use multiple materials for the text labels against the base plate. Variable
layer heights are used to reduce the stepping/contouring effect at the top of
the hemispheres.

The outer core quadrants on build plate 2 are identical to one another, and
only use multiple materials for the text labels against the base plate.
Supports are used for the inner core cutouts. Variable layer heights are used
to reduce the stepping/contouring effect at the top of the quadrants.

The mantle segments on build plates 3 and 4 are unique, and only use multiple
materials for the text labels against the base plate. Supports are used for the
outer core cutouts, but not the magnet slots against the base plate. The
segments on each plate are grouped together in assemblies to allow for variable
layer heights to be used to reduce the stepping/contouring effect at the top of
the segments.

The tectonic plate pieces on build plate 5 are carefully and compactly arranged
on a single build plate to minimise filament wastage while printing upright for
maximum quality on the large faces (avoiding stepping). Supports are used for
the overhanging magnet slots and to print unsliced minor plates on. Some of the
brims, supports, and purge tower edges may overlap slightly which should be
harmless, but it should be carefully checked in case your supports are
generated differently. These have been partly mitigated by grouping some of the
plates together in assemblies to encourage the slicer to generate supports more
sensibly.

Note that flush volumes have been reduced according to my own calibrations. It
is recommended you calibrate your own flush volumes between the colours used
for the tectonic plate pieces.


Inserting Magnets
-----------------

The magnet slots have a groove under them to allow them to be wiggled out with
a sharp object, so you can test that each one fits snuggly without wobbling
before removing them to apply glue. I used superglue which worked effectively.
For many of them you may have to carefully scrape the overhanging corner with a
craft knife to allow the magnets to be pushed in.

I chose to orient the magnets between mantle pieces so that all the northern
hemisphere segments were interchangeable by rotating around the poles, and
similarly for the southern hemisphere segments. All tectonic plate magnets were
oriented the same way so that any plate could roughly fit anywhere on the
mantle.
